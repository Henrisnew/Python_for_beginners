Hello!
First, my name is Henrique, and you and I are about to embark on a journey into a new universe of programming languages.
In this repository, I will try to offer tips and guidance to help you improve your coding skills.
Remember, just like learning to speak, learning a new programming language takes time!
So, be patient!
My goal here is to provide tools to spark your curiosity and encourage practice.
If you have any doubts or suggestions, please let me know!

Good luck!
